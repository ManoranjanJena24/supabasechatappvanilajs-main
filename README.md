This code implements a basic real-time chat application using **Supabase** as the backend. It handles authentication, user management, and messaging in a web-based UI. Here's a detailed explanation of the flow and how DOM manipulation happens:

---

## **Flow Overview**

1. **Initial Render:**
   - The page is rendered based on whether the user is logged in (`token` exists in `sessionStorage`).
   - If `token` is found, the chat interface (`renderChatPage`) is displayed.
   - If no `token`, the login page (`renderLoginPage`) is displayed.

2. **Authentication (Login & Signup):**
   - Users can log in or sign up via forms. Supabase handles authentication:
     - Login: `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword()`
     - Signup: `supabase.auth.signUp()`
   - After login, user data is stored in `sessionStorage`, and the chat page is rendered.

3. **User Loading:**
   - `loadUsers()` fetches all users via `supabase.auth.admin.listUsers()` and populates the user list in the sidebar (`users-container`).
   - Clicking on a user sets them as the `receiver` and updates the chat header (`Chat with <user>`).

4. **Real-Time Messaging:**
   - Supabase's `channel` subscribes to real-time changes in the `messages` table:
     - New messages are added to the DOM when an `INSERT` event occurs.
   - When the user sends a message (`sendMessage`), it's added to the database, and the message list is updated.

5. **Message Loading:**
   - `loadMessages()` fetches the chat history between the `sender` and `receiver` and renders them in the `messages-container`.

6. **Logout:**
   - The user can log out, clearing the session and redirecting to the login page.

## **DOM Manipulation Details**

### 1. **Login & Signup Forms:**
- **Rendering Forms:**
  - Login (`renderLoginPage`) and Signup (`renderSignUpPage`) are rendered by dynamically setting `innerHTML` of the `app` container.
- **Form Submission:**
  - `addEventListener('submit')` listens for form submissions, prevents the default behavior, and triggers Supabase API calls.
- **Post-Authentication:**
  - After login/signup, the token is stored, and the UI updates to the chat page.

---

### 2. **Chat Page:**
- **Initial Render:**
  - The chat interface is built dynamically via `innerHTML`. It includes:
    - **Sidebar**: Displays the list of users (`users-container`).
    - **Main Content**: Displays the chat header, messages, and input field.

- **User List:**
  - `loadUsers()` fetches users and populates the sidebar:
    - For each user, a `<div>` is created with `createElement('div')`.
    - `onclick` is attached to each user item to set the `receiver` and load their messages.

---

### 3. **Real-Time Messaging:**
- **Subscription to Real-Time Updates:**
  - Supabase's real-time channel listens to `INSERT` events in the `messages` table.
  - When a new message is inserted:
    - A new `<div>` is created dynamically for the message.
    - CSS classes (`sent` or `received`) are added based on the sender.
    - The new message is appended to `messages-container` via `appendChild()`.

- **Message Sending (`sendMessage`):**
  - When the user sends a message:
    - The content is added to the `messages` table via Supabase API.
    - The input field (`message-input`) is cleared.
    - `loadMessages()` updates the DOM with the latest messages.

---

### 4. **Loading Messages:**
- **Fetching Chat History:**
  - `loadMessages()` queries the `messages` table for messages between `sender` and `receiver`.
  - Each message is dynamically rendered as a `<div>` in `messages-container`:
    - CSS classes differentiate sent and received messages.
    - Timestamps are formatted using `toLocaleTimeString()`.

- **Auto-Scrolling:**
  - The `scrollTop` property ensures the chat scrolls to the latest message after rendering.

---

### 5. **Dynamic Updates in UI:**
- **Chat Header:**
  - The header dynamically updates to show `Chat with <receiver>` when a user is selected.

- **Real-Time Updates:**
  - Messages are dynamically appended to the DOM without reloading the page, thanks to Supabase's real-time functionality.

### Key DOM Manipulation Methods Used:
1. `innerHTML`: Used to render or clear content (e.g., login page, chat UI).
2. `createElement()`: Dynamically creates DOM elements (e.g., messages, user items).
3. `appendChild()`: Adds new elements to containers (e.g., new messages).
4. `addEventListener()`: Attaches event handlers to buttons, forms, or dynamic elements.
5. `scrollTo()`: Ensures the chat always scrolls to the latest message.
